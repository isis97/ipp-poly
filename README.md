Written in pure C99
Student's work (individual programistic project) at Warsaw University
Project purpose was to implement a polynomials interface based on bidirectional dynamically allocated lists.

## Building
Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/isis97/ipp-poly`
* Build files using    `mkdir release && cd release && cmake .. && make`
* Run tests using      `./test_poly`

This project is using general-purpose makefile scripts designed by me.

## Usage
Polynomial interface is well documented in `poly.h`.
